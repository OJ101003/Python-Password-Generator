# Python-Password-Generator
A basic password generator with personal preferences, making them easier for me to memorize

Ultimate goal would be to make a modular password generator with options such as including or excluding numbers or symbols

Some rules I used were that:
  1. No chararcter would repeat more than once unless the length of the password was greater than the available characters
  2. There wouldn't be any numbers right next to each other
